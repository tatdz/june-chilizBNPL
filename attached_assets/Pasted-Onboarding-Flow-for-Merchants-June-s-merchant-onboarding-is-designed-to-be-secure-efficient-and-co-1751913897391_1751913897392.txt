Fees & Conditions for Users
June’s BNPL is transparent and user-friendly. Here’s what users can expect:

Down Payment:
Pay an initial down payment (typically 25% of the purchase price) at checkout, using either fiat (via Stripe) or CHZ from your wallet.

Installments:
The remaining amount is split into equal installments over a fixed schedule (e.g., 3 payments over 60 days). Payment reminders and due dates are clearly communicated.

Yield Generation:
Users can enable yield by staking CHZ during repayment. Earned yield can offset the final installment, reducing your total cost.

Late Fees:
Late payments may incur a fixed fee or percentage penalty, always disclosed in advance.

Eligibility:

Must be 18+ and legally able to contract.

Pass KYC (Stripe Identity, sandbox; currently limited) and affordability checks (TrueLayer, sandbox; currently limited).

Use a supported wallet (Socios or MetaMask) with at least 5 transactions and 2+ months’ history.

Repayment:
Repay via fiat (Stripe) or CHZ. Missed payments may restrict future BNPL eligibility.

All fees and repayment conditions are disclosed before purchase. There are no hidden fees or interest for on-time payments.

Conditions for Merchants
Merchants benefit from June’s BNPL by increasing conversion and order value, while accepting the following conditions:

Merchant Fees:
Merchants pay a transaction fee to June for each BNPL purchase, typically ranging from 3% to 6% of the order value, depending on volume and agreement. This is in line with industry standards (e.g., Klarna).

Payout Timing:
Merchants receive the full order value (minus fees) within 24–48 hours of purchase, supporting healthy cash flow.

Integration:
Merchants must integrate June’s BNPL checkout or API. Technical support is provided.

Compliance:
Merchants must comply with AML/KYC regulations and June’s terms of service.

Customer Experience:
Merchants are expected to provide accurate product info, timely fulfillment, and support for BNPL customers.

Dispute Resolution:
June mediates payment disputes or chargebacks per industry best practices.

June’s merchant program is designed for growth, transparency, and minimal operational overhead.

Product Strategy
June’s strategy is to set the standard for transparent, flexible, and DeFi-powered BNPL:

User-Centric BNPL:
Seamless, on-chain BNPL with instant eligibility, flexible repayments, and optional yield generation.

Merchant Empowerment:
Fast onboarding, transparent fees (3%–6%), and rapid payouts to help merchants grow.

DeFi Integration:
Leverage Chiliz Chain and staking to enable yield on repayments—users can “pay as they earn.”

Scalable Partnerships:
Expand the merchant network through easy API integrations and merchant tools.

Regulatory Compliance:
Stay ahead of evolving BNPL regulations and best practices for user and merchant safety.

Growth Roadmap:

Launch with digital goods, Fan Tokens, NFTs, and event tickets.

Expand to travel, hospitality, and more.

Introduce loyalty and rewards for responsible repayment.

Enable real-time merchant search and deal discovery.

Continuously improve KYC/affordability flows as APIs mature.

June aims to redefine BNPL for the web3 era, making flexible payments accessible and rewarding for all.
