Content Guidance:

Mission:
Short, clear statement of June’s purpose.

Benefits for Users:
Flexible payments, on-chain transparency, access to exclusive assets, etc.

User Flow:
Step-by-step for users, including prerequisites (wallet type, tx history, KYC, affordability check).
Add a user flow diagram (use mermaid.js or an image).
Example steps:

Connect Wallet

Pass KYC (Stripe Identity, sandbox, currently fails)

Pass Affordability Check (TrueLayer, sandbox, currently fails)

Select Asset

Pay Down Payment

Pay Installments

Asset Release

Onboarding Flow for Merchants:
How merchants can join, what they need, and future partnership plans.

Tech Stack:
Chiliz Chain, Solidity, ethers.js, React, Moralis API, Stripe Identity, TrueLayer, etc.

KYC and Credit History:
Step-by-step on how Stripe and TrueLayer sandbox integrations work.
Known limitation: Both return “user doesn’t exist” errors in sandbox mode. This is a limitation of the sandbox/test environment, not a bug in the code.

Smart Contract:
Overview of contract logic, address, and ABI location.

Yield Generation:
How users can stake CHZ (testnet only), how yield is simulated, and how it offsets repayments.

Fees & Conditions for Users:
Downpayment %, installment schedule, late fees, asset release conditions, etc.

Conditions for Merchants:
How and when merchants get paid, future partnership onboarding.

Product Strategy:
Vision for scaling, merchant search, real partnerships, and roadmap.

Troubleshooting:
Common issues (sandbox KYC, TrueLayer user not found, wallet not eligible) and solutions.
